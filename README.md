## Overview

The Covid19 pandemic has taken over the entire world. It has caused millions of deaths and socio economic loss. After months of combined efforts, our scientists have finally developed vaccines against the virus. However, now the challenge is to vaccinate the population. For a country like India, vaccinating the entire 1.3 billion population quickly, securely and effectively is a tough challenge. We need a well designed solution to address this problem. Here is Team VaxU with a solution. A complete solution with a personalised app and admin portal, with on spot social distancing monitoring system and KYC verification model, which will make the process convenient, effective and hassle free.
